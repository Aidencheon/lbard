This program monitors a local Rhizome database and attempts
to synchronise it over low-bandwidth declarative transports, 
such as bluetooth name or wifi-direct service information
messages.  It is intended to give a high priority to MeshMS
converations among nearby nodes.

The design is fully asynchronous, so a call to the update_my_message()
function from time to time should be all that is required.

    Calculate a sync key for this bundle.
    Sync keys are relatively short, only 64 bits, as this is still sufficient to
    maintain a very low probability of colissions, provided that each peer has less
    than 2^32 bundles.

    Ideally we would hash the entire manifest of a bundle, but that would require us
    to retrieve each manifest, and we would rather not require that.  So instead we
    will use the BID, length, version and filehash as inputs.  This combination means
    that in the unlikely event of a colission, updating the bundle is almost certain
    to resolve the colission.  Thus the natural human response of sending another
    message if the first doesn't get through is likely to resolve the problem.

    The relatively small key space does however leave us potentially vulnerable to a
    determined adversary to find coliding hashes to disrupt communications. We will
    need to do something about this in due course. This could probably be protected
    by using a random salt between pairs of peers when they do the sync process, so
    that colissions cannot be arranged ahead of time.

    Using a salt, and changing it periodically, would also provide implicit protection
    against colissions of any source, so it is probably a really good idea to
    implement.  The main disadvantage is that we need to calculate all the hashes for
    all the bundles we hold whenever we talk to a new peer.  We could, however,
    use a salt for all peers which we update periodically, to offer a good compromise
    between computational cost and protection against accidental and intentional
    colissions.
    
    Under this strategy, we need to periodically recalculate the sync key, i.e, hash,
    for each bundle we hold, and invalidate the sync tree for each peer when we do so.

    ... HOWEVER, we need both sides of a conversation to have the same salt, which
    wouldn't work under that scheme.

    So for now we will employ a salt, but it will probably be fixed until we decide on
    a good solution to this set of problems.
